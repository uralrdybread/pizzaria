This is a restaurant pizzeria idea I came up with. I wanted do do a few things in particular with the site and that was the Search and Filter functionality

The Search function appears at the top of the screen and is fully functional. It queries for keywords in the title of foods.

The “chips” are a feature of Angular Material I’ve been wanting to use in some functional way. Clicking on a chip will filter down the list of food presented to the user. It does this by looking for keywords in the tags service associated with the food group. 

The project incorporates both BootStrap 5 and Angular Material. Eventually, I would like to clean up the item selection cards and maybe create a cart component to store and caluclate prices.
